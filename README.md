# Obesity level classification using Machine Learning Techniques

This project was made in order to learn machine learning techniques and try to classify obesity level.

## Code
- dataPreparationVis.py - data preparation to visualizations,
- visualization.py - data visualization,
- dataPreparation.py - data preparation for machine learning (with features selection),
- dT_sampling.py - Decision Tree classifier (with over and under sampling techniques),
- knn_sampling.py - KNN classifier (with over and under sampling techniques),
- logreg_sampling.py - Logistic Regression classifier (with over and under sampling techniques),
- rf_sampling.py - Random Forest classifier (with over and under sampling techniques),
- svm_sampling.py - Support vector machine classifier (with over and under sampling techniques).

## Versions
- All used packages and their versions are listed in  _requirements.txt_  file
- Python 3.8
- Anaconda 2020.07

## Data
Used data is from an internet survey prepared by me.

## Results
